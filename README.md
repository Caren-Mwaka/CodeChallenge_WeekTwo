## Description
A code challenge with three challenges one where you  write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character, another where you write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them and lastly a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.

# (Question 1)
Write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character. For example if you input 'The Quick Brown Fox' the output should be 'tHE qUICK bROWN fOX'.

Features:
Accepts a string as input.
Swaps the case of each character in the input string.
Returns the modified string with swapped cases.


# (Question 2)
Write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them. For example, if the two numbers are 4 and 7, the output should be [4, 5, 6, 7] and -4 and 7 should return [-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].

Features:
Accepts two numbers as input.
Generates an array of numbers starting from the first number up to the second number (inclusive).
Returns the generated array.

# (Question 3)
You are tasked with writing a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array. How would you implement this function efficiently, ensuring that it accurately identifies prime numbers and returns them in the same order they appear in the input array? For example if you provide an array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] it should return an array [2, 3, 5, 7].

Features:
Accepts an array of numbers as input.
Identifies and filters out prime numbers from the input array.
Returns a new array containing only the prime numbers in the same order as they appear in the input array.
