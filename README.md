# CodeChallenge_WeekTwo
A code challenge with three challenges one where you  write a function that accepts a string as input and swaps the case of each character, another where you write a JavaScript function that accepts two numbers to generate an array between them and lastly a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the prime numbers from the original array.
